  <description>
    Testing this requirement necessitates a few assumptions about some specific details:
    - "Any other" metadata refers to any metadata whos path is not defined by CSIPSTR6 (Preservation) and CSIPSTR7 (Descriptive)
    - If there is non preservation or descriptive metadata, you could place it anywhere with an advisory if that location is not a seperate sub-folder in metadata
    - The "seperate sub-folder" referred to in the requirement would be a sub-folder of the metadata path in the IP
    - There is no controlled vocab or convention for the title of the sub-folder
    
    Unfortunately this requirement is dependent on the definition of both "descriptive" and "preservation" metadata, neither of which have a defined schema in the specification.
    Since we cannot easily tell whether any given document is descriptive or preservation metadata, we also can't easily tell what isn't descriptive or preservation metadata
    and as such can't positively ascertain whether the parameters of the "other" metadata structure does or does not meet this requirement.
