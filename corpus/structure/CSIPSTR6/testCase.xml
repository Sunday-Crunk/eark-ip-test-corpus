  <description>
    This requirement is designed to recommend that all preservation metadata files, when included, are placed in the correct folder and not in any other location. 
    The test would need to check if any preservation metadata documents exist in the package and whether their location matches the recommended path.
    Unfortunately, the specification only recommends PREMIS for preservation metadata and does not require it. 
    This means it would be unreasonably complex to positively identify preservation metadata documents in the package and in turn warn if they are in the wrong location.
